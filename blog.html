				<h2> What is UTF-8? </h2>
			<div id='ccenter'>

				<p>
				Computers speak in bytes, humans speak in language. So UTF-8 is a code
				translating bytes to language? Not quite. There is another code in
				between bytes and language, namely a character encoding. UTF-8 is an
				encoding scheme for translating bytes to a character encoding, one of
				them being unicode, which in turn is translated to language. Here is a
				unicode character: ðŸŒŽ.
				</p>

				<p>
				The first computer character encoding was called ASCII or the American
				Standard for Information Interchange. ASCII has 128 code points, which
				are saved in a 7 bit byte instead of a 8 bit byte. That was later
				implemented for the extended ASCII which has 256 code points. The fact
				that ASCII has 128 code points is explained by the use of seven-bit
				teleprinter code in which it is based.
